Biochar Star

Biochar Star is a webpage template for a business.  The webpage submitted in class was designed to specifically satifsy requirements for the class.  I will  transition it to a business webpage in the future that sells biochar and related items. It was tested and works on Google Chrome. I used Chrome developer tools to test for responsive design.    

Css/Media queries: 
The colors chosen for website were primarily charcoal, black, and gray which reflects colors of biochar.  Green was also used to reflect nature.  I kept the webite design simple because primary users will be envrionmentally conscious people who prefer simplicity. I adjusted in css for mobile and desktop usage which meets the mobile first requirement. I used responsive design for the navigation bar which meets the class requirement.  It passes the responsive design goal of switching from horizontal to vertical when I tested it using Chrome developer tools. This meets the change in the navigation bar implementation.  It also  includes text that changes color when hovered over which was also an optional requirement. In adddition, I  also used responsive design for the contact page to include  Biochar Star's email and address. I designed it specifically without footers.  I wanted to meet the requirment of responsive design change of size of container objects using media queries at the end of the web page.   I also met the class requirement of making every other line on the list change color using nth child/nth of a type.  	    


Javascript and other functions
  I used javasript to aid in responsive design so it would change from mobile to desktop design  and allow for a better user interface. To demonstrate other requirements using javascripts/other functions( including php), I created user forms.  To meet requirements I used javascript on the name part of the form.  Once the user submits the name, the form would return Hello and the user's name.   I also validated email. I wanted to use a more advanced function than javacript to  check email validation so that it would be returned with either the positive validation message in green or not validated in red.  The comment section also returns a "your comment has been submitted" message above the comment section. 

  

Accessibility:  I followed best practices to ensure that the website was accessible for those users with slower internet connections. The html, css, and javascript was loaded in that order in order to allow for faster accesss.  I put as much styling components in css not html so it would load faster too.   I  personally designed a logo in  paint software.  I specifially placed on the last page so that fact that that star image clearly labeled with "biochar star would stand out as passing the accessbility requirement.  It was  designed to be in primarty colors and very simple on purpose  so that it loads quickly to pass project acessibility requirements.  I also  labeled the  buttons to meet accessibility rules.
