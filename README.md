Biochar Star is  on the github repository: deartc/biocharweb.  The mobile first size chosen was a large mobile phone.  
Biochar Star is a webpage template for an education website that will later transition into a business website. The webpage submitted in class was designed to specifically satisfy requirements for the class. I  own the domain name biocharstar.com and will transition it to a business webpage in the future that sells biochar and related items. It was tested and works on Google Chrome. I used Chrome developer tools to test for responsive design.

Css/Media queries: The colors chosen for the website were primarily charcoal, black, and gray which reflect colors of biochar. Green was also used to reflect nature. I kept the website design simple because primary users will be environmentally-conscious people who prefer simplicity. I also made it simple so I could design it to meet accessibility requirements.  
I used media queries in css to meet mobile and desktop usage. I used responsive design for the navigation bar which meets the class requirement of using media queries to aid in user interaction.   It passes the responsive design goal of switching from horizontal to vertical when I tested it using Chrome developer tools.  The navigation bar goes from horizontal to vertical but the menu bars must be activated first.  It was tested  on  Pixel 2xl. I also includes text that changes color when hovered over which was also an optional requirement. I also met the class requirement of making every other line on the list change color using nth child/nth of a type.
In addition, on the page with the Biochar Star logo, I also used responsive design  with media query to go from two columm rows  to one blended column when transitioning from large to  mobile devices to aid in a positive user's experience.  In addition, I used  media queries to aid in the  user's experience to make text disappear in mobile displays but appear in larger displays. 



JavaScript and jquery: I used javaScript to aid in responsive design so the navigation bar  would change from  horizontal to vertical depending on display size. To demonstrate other requirements using javaScript/jquery, I created user forms.  Since pyrolyzers' temperatures are so high to make biochar, I used javaScript in a  Fahrenheit to Celsius temperature conversion form to educate readers.  To  also meet a requirement, I used javaScript on the name part of the form.  Once the user submits the name, the form would return Hello and the user's name. I also used jquery in my webpage to validate email and comments.  I used it to check email validation so that it would be returned with either the positive validation message in green or not validated in red. The comment section also returns a "your comment has been submitted" message above the comment section.

Accessibility: I followed best practices to ensure that the website was accessible for those users with slower internet connections. I used Chrome developer tools to test the speed. The performance for blocking was 0.00 ms.  The html, css, and javascript was loaded in that order in order to allow for faster access. I put  most of styling components in css not html so it would load faster too. I chose a font that is simple to read to meet accessibility best practices.
In compliance to accessibility guidelines stated in class, I  limited the use of images to only those necessary for the webpage. I personally designed a logo in paint software that was simple.  It was designed to be in primary colors and very simple on purpose so that it loads quickly to meet accessibility best practices. I made sure I had no flashing animations.  It was designed to meet WCAG (web content accessibility guidelines). 

I complied with WCAG principles (perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust) as closely as possible as discussed in the Treehouse curriculum.  A git hub io repository
was generated and I tested accessbility on Google Lighthouse.  I got a 92 percent score on Lighthouse on accessbility.   This is the report in html format:
github.com-20210331T123735.html.


I also labeled the buttons to meet accessibility rules.  To comply with accessibility requirements, I used media queries so  the webpage can be seen on a desktop or mobile device. I tested accessibility in developer tools and got no error messages. 


Correct use of Git/Github and commits:  I followed the correct steps in the project guidelines to create and name the github repository that would reflect a distinct repository.  I then used the proper guidelines to initialize the project and add files using git bash and the command line.  I then far exceeded the minimum number of commits needed to pass.
