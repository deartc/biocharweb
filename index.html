<h2>Biochar Facts:</h2>

<!My website is an education website so it is more text oriented. Css was used more sparingly in certain parts of the webpage>

<p>Biochar is one of the oldest soil amendments. A soil amendment is a product that improves soil
quality and fertility when it is properly applied. Biochar is produced by heating air-dried plant
material (biomass) to a minimum temperature value of 750 degrees Fahrenheit in a reactor
(pyrolyzer) in which oxygen is deprived or lacking. The biomass and the production process
greatly affect properties of biochars and their perseverance and functions in the soil environment.
Normally, biochars that are produced with the highest treatment temperature (HTT) above 750°F
(400°C) are significantly different physically and chemically the chars.</p>

<p>During the past few years, there has been a focus on biochar in many scientific studies. The latest
research shows that all biochars produced through slow pyrolysis have some nutrients essential
for plant growth right after their production. Herbaceous biochars typically include more
nitrogen than ligneous biochars. Plants, however, need more nitrogen than biochar can provide to
grow optimally. Biochar is not considered a fertilizer. All biochars contain some mineral matter (ash). </p>



<p>The neutralizing ability of biochar can increase nutrient availability in the soil environment close
to plant roots (rhizosphere). All biochars have a higher specific surface area (SSA) than their
biomass precursors. The specific surface area is a property of solids in which the total surface
area is divided by the mass or volume. The pores in biochar retain water and nutrients; they also
provide a good place for some beneficial microorganisms to grow. This is especially true when
biochar contacts growing roots. </p>



<p>When applied properly to the soil, biochars can promote plant growth and increase yield. To be successful, crop production using
biochar requires a good understanding of both soils and biochars. Other factors involved in plant
growth must also be taken into account. Otherwise, biochar application can reduce plant growth
and decrease yield. For example, if biochar is used at higher rates than required, it could impair
plant growth. If biochar is applied to a soil with a high pH and electrical conductivity (the ability
to transmit an electric current), the permanent wilting point,
if water is limited. Hence, the positive effects of biochar can only be reaped when the farmer
develops proper soil and crop management practices. These practices are based on an
understanding of biochars, soils, and the needs of agronomic crops. </p>



<p>An example of a carbon negative act is when biomass (e.g., in the swamps) was buried due to
cataclysmic events in Earth’s history. The carbon from the atmosphere was sequestered
(contained) through photosynthesis. In so doing, a key component of biomass (carbon) was
buried in the earth. Although biochar properties are completely different from those of coal,
when biochar is mixed with the topsoil (0-6 in.; 0-15 cm), the carbon is effectively removed from
the atmosphere. It is buried in the soil, helping plants grow better. The biochar can remain in the
soil for hundreds of years. Carbon negative processes are beneficial for the planet. </p>



<p>A carbon positive practice occurs when carbon that had been permanently removed from the
atmosphere and buried in the earth is combusted. An example is the combustion of coal and
hydrocarbons. This creates greenhouse gases and is harmful. </p>



<p>When a tree dies or parts of it die, the fallen parts disintegrate, decompose, and over time,
change into carbon dioxide. This gas is returned to the environment. In other words, the carbon
that was temporarily removed from the atmosphere by photosynthesis is quickly returned to the
atmosphere. Hence, there is no net change in atmospheric carbon. This is a carbon neutral
process. Burning wood in a fireplace is a carbon neutral practice. </p>


<p> When biochar is made in a double-barrel pyrolyzer as explained above, a minimal amount of biomass is combusted to start
the pyrolysis process. The combusted biomass is carbon neutral. However, the resulting biochar,
if mixed with the soil, constitutes a carbon negative practice. 
A biochar system normally includes all of these processes, but the net result is carbon negative. </p>

<h2>Biochar Star’s Vision Statement - Mission Statement - Company Founder:</h2>
<p>
<h3>Vision Statement:</h3>
         <p> The vision of Biochar Star is to lead the biochar market and research the possibilities of other environmentally safe and sustainable soil supplement. Biochar is produced through a process named pyrolysis.  Biochar that is produced at higher temperature has more sorption capacity. By perfecting this process Biochar Star will provide a soil supplement with no added chemicals that will be better than others on the market. </p> 

                                      <h3>Mission Statement:</h3>
<p>Biochar is the solid byproduct of biofuel production from the biomass in an oxygen deprived
environment. The other products are the combustible gases (syngas) and a liquid phase (biofuel).
<p>The biochar system can lead to economic growth. This can occur if biochar is produced
sustainably as a co-product of the bioenergy being made from the biomass. Biochar production
should be seen as one part of a larger design: biochar is one of its products but not the sole
product. As biochar is used more in agriculture and industry, its value will increase.  </p>  Biochar Star hopes to implement a cost effective process that ensures all byproducts are utilized.  Biochar Star will form an cooperative effort with agricultural industry and the forestry industry to utilize their waste products and utilize them environmentally and efficiently. Biochar Star will also help in the production of synfuel manufacturing with the byproducts of producing biochar. 
</p>


<h3> Company Founder: </h3>
Dr. Ray Bayan started Biochar Star in
          2017 to educate the public on biochar and sell products that promote the use of biochar.
  He is a soil scientist, clay mineralogist, and an environmental
          geochemist. He has doctorate degrees in both soil and geological sciences. His
          undergraduate degrees are in agricultural engineering and computer science
          and information technology. He received his education in the United States
          from Iowa State University and the University of Kentucky. Shortly after his
          academic training he started an environmental engineering company named
          The E-TEC Group, LLC (Environmental Testing, Engineering, and Consulting). In
          2010, he joined the faculty of Lincoln University to devote his life to research
          and teaching of basic agricultural and environmental concepts to socially under advantaged students.
          In a short period, since his return to academics, the
          significance of his research was recognized by the International Biochar
          Initiative (IBI) and was selected to serve on its advisory board.  </p>
